## Who are the anticodians?

Anticodians is a [critical code studies](https://criticalcodestudies.com/) reading group from the [antipodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes). We meet fortnightly to read code slowly, picking through the source line-by-line to understand how and why it was written the way it was.

We are readers, rather than engineers, though some of us enjoy engineering too.

If you would like to join us, email [Michael Falk](mailto:%6D%69%63%68%61%65%6C.%66%61%6C%6B@%75%6E%69%6D%65%6C%62.%65%64%75.%61%75) for an invitation.

## We're currently reading

Donald Ervin Knuth, “[Literate Programming](https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-pdf/27/2/97/981657/270097.pdf),” *The Computer Journal* 27, no. 2 (1984): 97–111.

## We have read

`10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10`: Just the program, but [the book](https://10print.org) is well worth it.
